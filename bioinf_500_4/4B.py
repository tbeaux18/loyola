B) Purebred or puremutt? (6 pts) You adopted your pup from a local shelter and are amazed how much
Spot resembles the latest Westminster Best of Show. You assumed he was a mutt, but perhaps he’s a
purebred. We have access to a collection of 79 markers that collectively can be used to identify the bred
of your pup (see Supplemental_Table.csv; from Jones et al. 2008). The SNPs are indicated for each
marker, e.g., [C/G]. After sequencing Spot’s genome, you want to identify his genotype. To solve this
problem, let’s use the BWT approach. Let’s assume that each of these markers is shorter than the size of
our sequencing reads. Output the genotype, the SNP name (1st column of the table) and the allele
present in your pooch, e.g., a C or a G. Remember, not all reads will map to one of these markers.
