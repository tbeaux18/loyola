E) Construct a Eulerian Cycle from a de Bruijn graph using the following pseudocode:
EULERIANCYCLE(Graph)
form a cycle Cycle by randomly walking in Graph (don’t visit the same edge twice!)
while there are unexplored edges in Graph
select a node newStart in Cycle with still unexplored edges
form Cycle’ by traversing Cycle (starting at newStart) and then randomly walking
Cycle ← Cycle’
return Cycle
